Abstraction:
  Allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to the user
  In Java, we can achieve this in two ways:
  1)abstract classes
  2)Interface

Interface:
   Is very similar to a abstract class. We can have private methods, static methods, default methods,abstract methods.
   We can be static in a interface. We can't have instance fields in a interface and because we don't
   have instance fields, we also can't have a constructor in an interface.

Why should we learn about interface?
    When objects are closely related to each other and there is an "Is a" relationship between classes then we should go
    with abstract classes if we want to use abstraction. If objects are not related to each other then we should implement
    abstract with the help of interfaces.
